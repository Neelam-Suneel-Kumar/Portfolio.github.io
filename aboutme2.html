        <p><br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Suneel Kumar</b> from Nellore. I completed my secondary education at Ravindra Bharathi School and continued my studies in the MPC stream at Sri Gayatri Junior College, both located in Nellore. After that, I pursued my passion for Electronics and Communication Engineering and completed my graduation at NBKRIST in Vidyanagar, Kota.<br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from academics, I have a diverse range of hobbies. I love creating videos on YouTube,&nbsp; capturing moments through photography, and expressing my creativity through drawing and painting.<br><br>
            
            On the technical side, I have honed my skills in Java, SQL, HTML, and CSS, which has equipped me with the knowledge to develop software and websites.<br><br>
            
            I am an enthusiastic individual who enjoys learning and exploring new things. I believe in continuous improvement and always strive to push myself beyond my comfort zone.<br><br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and I am eager to contribute my skills and&nbsp;&nbsp; knowledge to make a positive impact in the fields of software/web development.<br><br></p>
