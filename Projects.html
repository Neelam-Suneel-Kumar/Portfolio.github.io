                <p>A bandpass filter is defined as a wide bandpass if its figure of merit or quality factor Q is less than 10 while the bandpass filters with Q > 10 are called the narrow bandpass filters.</p>

                <p>A Narrow band pass filter is one that allows a narrow range of frequencies around a center frequency to pass with minimum attenuation but rejects frequencies above or below this range . Narrow band pass filter is a multiple feedback circuit . <q>The bandwidth of a Narrow bandpass filter is Narrow .</q>The narrow band pass filter is designed for only specific frequencies .</p>

        <li><h3>Detection of cyberbullying on social media using machine learning</h3></li>
    </ul>
    <fieldset>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyberbullying is a major problem encountered on internet that affects teenagers and also adults. It has lead to mishappenings like suicide and depression. Regulation of content on Social media platforms has become a growing need. The following study uses data from two different forms of cyberbullying, hate speech tweets from Twitter and comments based on personal attacks from Wikipedia forums to build a model based on detection of Cyberbullying in text data using Natural Language Processing and Machine learning. Three methods for Feature extraction and four classifiers are studied to outline the best approach. For Tweet data the model provides accuracies above 90% and for Wikipedia data it gives accuracies above 80%.</p>
